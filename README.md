# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate - Functional Programming

WordPress plugin boilerplate using functional programming approach with namespaces.

## Why this boilerplate?
Many WordPress plugin developers defaults to OOP without actually using classes for anything else than namespaces. This just makes the code more bloated in our honest opinion. Since PHP actually supports namespaces, why not use it?

This is simply a super light starter for smaller plugin projects intended to help us :-) However, if this approach exites you; feel free to contribute.

Happy Coding!
